    "# About Me",
    "Hello, I’m Joshua — a Dutch-American designer and developer living just outside of Nashville with my amazing wife Chihiro and our two lovable Morkies, Adobe and Pixel.",
    "![Family](/images/family.jpg){family}",
    "For over 15 years, I’ve shaped digital and physical brand experiences for startups, nonprofits, and international companies. I’ve worked for one of the world’s top 10 direct sales companies, where I led projects across web, UI/UX, and full-stack development. But my creative foundation is broad — rooted in print, branding, packaging, and even motion graphics. Whether designing a brand or coding an interface, I’ve always enjoyed bridging disciplines to solve real problems with thoughtful, forward-thinking design.",
    "I’m a full-stack developer and creator of several open-source tools, including the Arcane microframework — a minimalist PHP tool built for rapid prototyping with near-zero setup. I’m also currently building Watched FYI, a progressive web app for tracking shows and movies. These side projects come from a deep love of problem-solving and a desire to build tools that feel intuitive — and maybe even a little fun.",
    "When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll usually find me in Azeroth. I’ve played World of Warcraft since 2005, and at just 13, I built one of my first projects: Fusion9, a creative community for gamers and designers. I’m also a dedicated TV and film enthusiast, with over 16,000 episodes watched and a deep appreciation for sharp writing, compelling characters, and stylized storytelling — especially anything from Tarantino.",
    "I believe great design is intuitive, intentional, and invisible. My work spans branding, UI/UX, front-end and back-end development, often blurring the lines between roles to bring ideas to life in the cleanest, most efficient way possible. Whether I’m shaping a visual identity, architecting a CMS, or obsessing over CSS transitions, I’m always chasing that sweet spot where form meets function.",
    "If I had to describe my approach, it would be this: curious by nature, precise by practice, and never afraid to rethink the rules. I love starting from scratch, simplifying the complex, and building things that just feel good to use — a creative instigator."
