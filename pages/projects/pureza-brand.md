# PureZa Brand

### Identity & Print

The logo system was designed to be flexible yet cohesive. The main seal incorporates a zigzag edge reminiscent of vintage quality stamps or certificates, adding a subtle nod to heritage and reliability. This edge detail wasn't just decorative — it became the foundation for an extended design language. I carried this wave-like motif throughout the print system, using it as a framing element and mask to create continuity across collateral pieces.

I also created a secondary logo variation specifically for PureZa's charitable outreach. The flexibility between these marks allowed the brand to maintain visual unity across different types of communication without sacrificing clarity or intent.

One of my favorite elements was the business card system, where each card displayed a unique segment of the logo. When placed together, the backs formed a complete picture — reinforcing the brand's collective spirit. The overall system was designed to feel consistent yet full of personality, ensuring PureZa stood out with both polish and heart.

In addition to the core identity work, I also developed key print pieces including a founder's kit, nutrition comparison flyers, a compensation plan booklet, and promotional materials. These assets were designed for clarity and cohesion, utilizing the same visual vocabulary established in the branding system to ensure everything felt like part of a whole.
