# Helix Brand

### Identity & Print

This conceptual project focused on developing a brand identity system for Helix, a fictional tech company with a modern, modular structure. I designed the logo to represent a helix viewed from above, creating a clean, geometric form that serves as the foundation for a dynamic visual language.

To differentiate departments within the company, I introduced a color-coded system, with each variation of the mark representing a specific focus areaâ€”such as mobile, tablet, laptop, audio, and camera divisions. This created a flexible identity system that could scale with the brand's needs while maintaining visual consistency.

The project also included the design of print collateral such as business cards and letterhead, extending the brand's core visual elements into tactile applications. Clean typography, bold diagonals, and a minimalist layout were used to reinforce the brand's modern, tech-forward aesthetic.

*This project was recognized by the American Advertising Federation Nashville, earning a Silver Student ADDY Award in 2012 for logo design.*
