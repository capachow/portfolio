# PureZa Web

### Interactive

I designed and developed a custom WordPress theme for PureZa For Life. The site was built with brand cohesion at the forefront, incorporating the same color bar system used across the company's product lines and marketing materials â€” but flipped to the top of the site for visual distinction and continuity.

As a unique detail, I implemented a hidden easter egg: when users clicked on the donation ribbon icon, the entire color scheme of the site would dynamically switch from green to orange, and the logo would seamlessly swap to a matching variant. This small interactive feature reinforced the brand's philanthropic goals while adding a bit of delight and personality to the user experience.
