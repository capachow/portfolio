# NEGEN Class

### Identity & Print

Created for Business of Visual Communications, this project involved branding and designing a student portfolio booklet for a class of nine design students. I developed the name NEGEN, which means “nine” in Dutch, as a nod to both the team and my own heritage. The logo combines the elegance of Garamond with the clarity of Helvetica, symbolizing the balance between classic form and modern structure.

The supporting booklet design centers around abstract, intersecting triangles—strategically placed to create nine visual points: three at their intersections and six around the edges. This subtle geometry reinforced the concept of nine individuals coming together as one collective identity. I handled the logo, layout concept, and full print execution for the project.

*This project was recognized by the American Advertising Federation Nashville, earning a Gold Student ADDY Award in 2012 for logo design.*
