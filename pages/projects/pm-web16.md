My first project at PM-International involved re-skinning their legacy website to give it a more modern, user-friendly aesthetic â€” without altering the underlying structure. Time constraints and existing backend limitations meant the site couldn't yet be made responsive, so the redesign was carefully layered on top of the existing framework, using a clean, geometric visual language that matched the company's global brand identity.
