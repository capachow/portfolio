# Amsterdam 2028

### Identity & Interactive

This project involved developing a full brand identity and digital experience for a hypothetical Olympic Games hosted in Amsterdam in 2028. I designed both the logo and website from the ground up, with a focus on cultural symbolism, visual cohesion, and user experience.

The logo is built around themes central to Dutch identity: the national color orange, the country's royal heritage represented by a tulip-shaped crown, and a pentagon form that brings it all together. The pentagon also symbolizes five defining traits that Olympic athletes bring to the Games — passion, bravery, commitment, wisdom, and honor.

These design elements carried over into the website, where I incorporated angular, layered shapes and a custom image slider to highlight past Olympic Games and featured athletes. The warm palette and structured layout were chosen to reflect national pride, energy, and forward momentum—qualities that define both the host country and the Olympic spirit.
