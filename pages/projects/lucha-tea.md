# Lüchá Tea

### Identity & Packaging

Created for Package Design I, this project challenged me to blend traditional culture with modern sustainability. Lüchá, which means “green tea” in Chinese, was envisioned as a contemporary, environmentally friendly tea brand rooted in heritage. I developed the brand from the ground up — designing the logo, packaging, and physical structure.

The logo was hand-drawn to reflect the playful, organic flow of Chinese characters while maintaining a polished, professional tone. The packaging was designed using 100% recycled brown paper and assembled without adhesives—the structure snaps shut using only the tension and weight of its own material. A unique die-cut window, inspired by the custom logo mark, allows a peek at the loose-leaf tea inside, reinforcing the natural, transparent character of the product.

It remains one of my most personal and rewarding creations — where storytelling, craftsmanship, and sustainability came together in a cohesive brand experience.
