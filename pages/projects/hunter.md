# Hunter Marine

### Interactive

Client work for a Nashville-based marine transportation company. This was one of the first projects completed under the MEDIA76 freelance group I co-founded. The client wanted a professional yet engaging digital presence. I designed a clean, modern website anchored by a custom image banner that featured a grid-based hover effect â€” giving visitors an interactive way to explore the brand visually.
