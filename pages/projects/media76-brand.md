# MEDIA76 Brand

### Identity & Interactive

Originally created as a student project, MEDIA76 evolved into a freelance creative studio I co-founded during college with Andrew Wierzba. The goal was to provide thoughtful, full-spectrum creative services across four core disciplines: web development, corporate identity, video production, and digital photography. I designed the visual identity and the company website, which served as both our brand hub and client platform.

The logo mark is a stylized fusion of the numbers 7 and 6, visually constructed from four vertical shapes — each representing one of the studio's key service areas. The mark was designed to be used as a transparent overlay, symbolizing the idea that our role was not to overshadow our clients' work, but to support and elevate it — allowing their story, passion, and voice to remain at the forefront. Over time, this identity became so personally meaningful that I adopted it as my own.

*This project was recognized by the American Advertising Federation Nashville, earning a Silver Student ADDY Award in 2011 for web design. It also went on to win Gold at the AAF District 7 Student ADDY Awards in 2011 (covering Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee).*
