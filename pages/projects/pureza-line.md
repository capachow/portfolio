# PureZa Line

### Packaging

 I wanted each category to visually reflect its purpose and personality while staying cohesive as a brand family. For the treats line, I used bold, saturated colors that tied directly to the main ingredients — like green for spinach or orange for carrots — creating an intuitive connection for pet parents. This flavor-based color system helped distinguish products quickly on shelves while reinforcing their real-food ingredients.

The supplement line, in contrast, was given a more clinical, trustworthy aesthetic. Greyscale tones were used as the foundation to convey a sense of medical professionalism, while subtle pastel accents added warmth and differentiation without sacrificing that credibility. For the KitchenFresh baking mix, red was chosen for its association with home kitchens and appetite appeal. I paired handwritten and serif fonts to evoke a sense of homemade luxury, blending gourmet charm with health-focused intent.

The unreleased dog food line embraced bold design and vibrant food photography to spotlight the real, whole ingredients inside. The recognizable wave graphic from our treats line was reimagined here in a more pronounced way, uniting the entire brand visually. Together, these intentional color and design systems brought clarity, synergy, and purpose across PureZa’s expanding product family.
