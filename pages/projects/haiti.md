# Haiti Foundation

### Interactive

Created for Interactive Design I, this project was more than just a class assignment â€” it became an opportunity to give back. In response to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, I chose to design and build a new website for the Haiti Foundation Against Poverty (HFAP), a nonprofit organization focused on providing shelter, education, and essential support to Haitian children and families.

While the foundation ultimately informed me that a new site was already in development, they expressed genuine gratitude for the effort and design.
