# Haiti Foundation

### Interactive

Created for Interactive Design I, this project was more than just a class assignment — it became an opportunity to give back. In response to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, I chose to design and build a new website for the Haiti Foundation Against Poverty (HFAP), a nonprofit organization focused on providing shelter, education, and essential support to Haitian children and families.

While the foundation ultimately informed me that a new site was already in development, they expressed genuine gratitude for the effort and design. The experience allowed me to apply my skills toward something meaningful, and to explore how design can serve both communication and compassion. Even though the site was not launched publicly, it was a valuable step in my growth as both a designer and a human being.

This project reflects my belief that design should be purposeful — and when possible, generous.
